Every dialogue box can contain a maximum of 4 lines. Line character limit slightly varies depending on which letters are used in each sentence, which can be a bit annoying. 

Generally speaking:
Line character limit (dialogue with no face sprites): 49

Line character limit (dialogue with face sprites): 38
